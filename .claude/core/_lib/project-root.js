/**
 * Resolve the project root that anchors per-project GITIGNORED working state —
 * above all the regenerable/transient half of the memory store now under
 * docs/.output/.state/memory-{index,inbox,daily} (the rebuilt FTS5 db, the
 * sub-agent inbox drafts, and the raw daily logs). ADR 0006 Amendment 2 split
 * the store: the curated JSON SOURCE moved to docs/.output/.memory/ and is now
 * TRACKED — resolve THAT with resolveWorktreeRoot() below, not this function.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the git-worktree memory-loss bug. A worktree only checks out
 * TRACKED files, so any GITIGNORED store starts EMPTY in a fresh worktree and
 * anything written there is deleted with the worktree. The ignored .state/ half
 * must therefore be SHARED across the main repo and every linked worktree by
 * anchoring it to the main worktree. (The tracked .memory/ source no longer
 * needs this — git checks it out into each worktree naturally.)
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR — explicit override, always wins.
 *   2. The MAIN worktree root, via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`. The common
 *      dir ("<mainRoot>/.git") is shared by the main repo and every linked
 *      worktree, so this returns the same path everywhere → one shared store,
 *      no copy, nothing lost on worktree removal.
 *   3. `fallbackDir` — the caller's own location (non-git / standalone template).
 *
 * `fallbackDir` is the caller's `path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..')`; it is
 * used both as the git-query cwd and as the last-resort root.

/**

 * SOURCE at docs/.output/.memory/ (ADR 0006 Amendment 2).
 *
 * This is the counterpart to resolveProjectRoot(): where that one anchors the
 * gitignored .state/ half to the MAIN worktree (so it is shared, not lost), this
 * one returns the CURRENT worktree's top — because a tracked file is physically
 * present in whichever worktree you are in, and the source-of-truth edits should
 * land in that worktree's checkout, not the main repo's.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR — explicit override, always wins (parity with above).
 *   2. The current worktree top, via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. In the
 *      MAIN worktree this equals resolveProjectRoot(); they diverge only inside
 *      a linked worktree, which is exactly the case the split is for.
 *   3. `fallbackDir` — the caller's own location (non-git / standalone template).
