/**
 * migrate-output-layout — the one deterministic, unit-tested codemod that moves
 * docs/.output/ from its flat, multi-era compartment layout into the ADR-0006
 * four-concern-group taxonomy (findings/ · plans · handoffs · evolution/), every
 * artifact month-bucketed at {group}/{kind}/{YYYY-MM}/. Mirrors the proven
 * migrate-docs-domains.js playbook; lives in .claude/core/ so it propagates to
 * adopters on fleet:sync — each runs it on its OWN .output/ on its own schedule.
 *
 * THE KEY DIFFERENCE from migrate-docs-domains: --move cannot use a static file
 * list. The durable compartments hold hundreds of dated files; the mover
 * ENUMERATES each old compartment at runtime and computes the destination
 * {group}/{kind}/{YYYY-MM}/ from each filename's own date. Un-dated artifacts are
 * PARKED (reported, never moved to a guessed month); ad-hoc non-date subdirs under
 * discrete compartments (the investigations/database/958 anti-pattern) are FLAGGED.
 *
 * Two tables, one taxonomy:
 *   COMPARTMENT_MAP — old top-level compartment dir → { kind, shape } (drives --move).
 *                     `kind` is an OUTPUT_PATHS key; the target dir is read from the
 *                     registry (single source — never re-hardcoded here).
 *   REF_REWRITES    — .output/-prefixed path tokens to rewrite (drives --refs/--verify).
 *                     Sorted longest-first at load so a specific token always wins
 *                     over a substring of it. Boundary-anchored so a token only
 *                     matches a real path occurrence, never a fragment of a longer
 *                     identifier. Covers the compartment relocations AND the Wave 1
 *                     `.state/` prose gotcha (code moved to .state/ but prose lagged).
 *
 * TRACKED-WORK CARVE-OUT: the bare `.output/work` token reclassifies to the gitignored
 * `.state/work`. That is correct ONLY when `.output/work/` is genuine ephemeral scratch.
 * Older repos accreted durable, CITED content there (CLAUDE.md / immutable ADRs / TODOs
 * point into it); reclassifying that would de-track it and 404 the citations. So --refs
 * and --verify check `git ls-files .output/work` and, when it is non-empty, DROP the
 * work→.state rule (a loud notice explains why + names the on-taxonomy home, findings/).
 * --migrate-tracked-work forces it. The workshop has 0 tracked there, so this is a no-op
 * for it and auto-protects adopters.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   --move   <outputRoot> [--apply] [--date-undated]      enumerate + git mv (dry-run default)
 *   --refs   [--apply] [--root <dir>] [--migrate-tracked-work] [paths…]   rewrite refs (dry-run default)
 *   --verify [--root <dir>] [--migrate-tracked-work] [paths…]             grep survivors; exit 1 if any
 *
 * --date-undated: instead of parking artifacts with no in-filename date, give each
 * its REAL create-date (the first commit that added it, else fs birthtime) as a
 * {YYMMDD-HHMM} prefix and bucket it normally; persistent ledger/index files
 * (_decisions.md, README.md) land at the compartment root with no month. An item
 * whose create-date can't be resolved stays parked — still never guessed.
 *
 * Safety: dry-run first, idempotent (re-run is a no-op — new paths don't match old
 * tokens; already-bucketed month dirs at their final home are skipped), self-
 * verifying, skip-allowlisted (never touches _archive/, generated .output/, ADRs,
 * CHANGELOG, or the migration codemods whose bodies carry legacy literals as DATA).
 * A line carrying the `migrate:keep` marker passes through verbatim. memories/ is
 * OUT OF SCOPE — its three-tier split is Wave 1b (a different resolver), so this
 * codemod never moves or rewrites a memories/ path.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 verify found survivors · 2 usage error.
