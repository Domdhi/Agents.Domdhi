# Prime

Cold-start a new session. CLAUDE.md + agent memory already auto-load — this command fills in the gaps: what happened recently, what's next, and is anything broken.

## Telemetry (run first)

This command is user-typed, so it does not fire `PostToolUse:Skill` — without this it leaves no `command_invocation` row and fleet analytics under-count human-driven runs. Self-log the invocation before anything else (best-effort — if it fails, continue regardless):

```bash
node .claude/core/telemetry-log.js prime
```

## Variables

TASK_DESCRIPTION: CONTEXT

- `CONTEXT` (optional): File(s) or folder(s) to read instead of the default workflow. Use when you need to deep-dive a specific area.

## Workflow

- If `CONTEXT` is provided:
  - Read each file or folder specified
  - Summarize what you found
  - Done — skip the rest

- Else run the **cold-start sequence**:

### Step 1: Read the handoff + git reality (parallel)

Resolve the handoff path first — handoffs are per-session/per-branch files under `docs/.output/handoffs/`, and the resolver returns the newest one for the current branch (falling back to the newest overall):
```
HANDOFF=$(node .claude/core/handoff-path.js latest)
```
Then read it alongside git reality:
```
Read $HANDOFF        # the resolved handoff (skip if empty — none yet)
git log --oneline -20
git status --short
```
The handoff has decisions, intent, blockers, and next actions from the previous session. Git is the source of truth — do NOT trust the handoff over git. If `$HANDOFF` is empty (no handoff exists yet), scan `docs/work/backlog.md` instead.

### Step 2: Read Key Files + forward-looking memory (one parallel batch)

Both reads depend only on the handoff (Step 1) and not on each other — so fire them together in a single parallel batch, not back-to-back.

**Key Files** — the handoff's `## Key Files` section is the curated short list needed to resume work. Read every path listed:
- Extract paths from bullets under `## Key Files` (ignore line-range annotations like `:47-89` — read the whole file)
- Skip anything that isn't a readable file (directories, globs, missing files — note them but don't fail)
- If the handoff has no `## Key Files` section, skip the file reads
- Also read any file explicitly called out in `## Next Actions` as the first file to touch — one or two, don't chase every mention

Listing files without reading them is worthless; the next session needs the content loaded to act on step one of Next Actions immediately.

**Forward-looking memory** — the SessionStart hook already injected a generic top-8 by decayed confidence × usage. Add *forward-looking* recall that bears on the next action specifically:
1. Extract 2-4 concrete noun phrases from the handoff's `## Next Actions` (file names, feature names, technical concepts — skip filler like "decide", "verify").
2. `node .claude/core/memory-manager.js search "<phrases joined>"`
3. Take the top 3 by `decayed_confidence * relevance`.
4. **Dedupe against the SessionStart top-8** (already in context as a `<project_memory>` system-reminder) — skip hits whose `id` appears there.
5. For each remaining hit directly relevant to the first Next Action, `cat docs/.output/.memory/{category}/{id}.json` and surface the rule.

Skip the memory search silently if Next Actions is empty/stale, search returns nothing, every hit dupes the top-8, or all `decayed_confidence < 0.3` — then render the **Loaded** section's memory line as `(no memories beyond SessionStart top-8)`.

### Step 3: Verify & synthesize

Compare the handoff against git reality:
- If handoff says "next: implement X" but `git log` shows X was already committed → **flag as stale**, ignore that action
- If handoff is missing or completely stale → scan `docs/work/backlog.md` for pending work
- If a Key File's current contents contradict the handoff's description of it → trust the file, flag the drift

## Report

Provide a substantive summary (**30-60 lines**) that gives enough context to start working immediately. Use this exact template — every section is required, every label is verbatim, even when a section is empty.

Ordered **bottom-up**: the most actionable content sits at the bottom, closest to the input box where the eye lands first; provenance (recent work, loaded files/memories) sits at the top, read last or skipped.

```markdown
## Cold-start summary

**Recent work** (last 3-5 commits):
- `{hash}` {subject} — {one-line why-it-matters}
- `{hash}` {subject} — {one-line why-it-matters}

**Loaded** (what this summary was built from — files + memory)
- ✓ `{path}` — Key File from handoff
- ✗ skipped `{path}` — {reason: missing, directory, glob, etc.}
- 🧠 `{category}/{id}` (rel {N.N}, conf {N.NN}) — {one-line takeaway}

**State**
- Branch: `{branch}`, working tree {clean | N modified files}
- Build: {last gate status + count, or "unknown"}
- {anything notable about deployed/remote state}

**Decisions & context**
- {decision from handoff with the reasoning, not just the conclusion}
- {next decision with reasoning}

**⚠ Handoff drift** (only if detected — omit the section if handoff matches git)
- {what the handoff says vs what git shows, with commit hashes}

**Next actions**
1. {action with enough detail to start immediately — file paths, what to search for, approach to try first}
2. {next action}

**Blockers** (only if still relevant — omit the section if none)
- {blocker, with what was already tried}

▶ **Start here:** {the single most important next step in one line — the literal last line of the report}
```

### Section rules

- **Order is fixed (bottom-up).** Recent work → Loaded → State → Decisions → (drift if any) → Next actions → (blockers if any) → ▶ Start here. The gradient runs least-actionable at top to most-actionable at bottom.
- **▶ Start here is always the literal last line.** One line, the single highest-value next step — never followed by anything else.
- **Route genuinely-new work through `/route`.** When the highest-value next step is a *new* feature or a scope-unclear request — not resuming an in-flight story, not a known bugfix — render `▶ Start here:` as `/route {description}` so scale-aware pipeline depth gets chosen instead of defaulting to `/todo`. This is the only place the front-door router is surfaced in the daily loop. When resuming work already in flight, the handoff's concrete next action IS the right Start-here — do not re-route it.
- **Loaded is always present** and merges files + memory. Always render the heading. If the handoff had no Key Files, write `(no Key Files in handoff)`; if the memory search was skipped or dry, render its memory line as `(no memories beyond SessionStart top-8)`.
- **Optional sections are explicitly optional.** Only Handoff drift and Blockers may be omitted, and only when there is genuinely nothing to report.

## What NOT to Do
- Do NOT read `architecture/overview.md` or `product/context.md` — CLAUDE.md already has this
- Do NOT read CLAUDE.md — it auto-loads, reading it again wastes tokens
- Do NOT load full planning docs unless the handoff is stale/missing
- Do NOT produce a report under 20 lines — that's too sparse to cold-start from
- Do NOT exceed 60 lines — that's a novel
