# Documentation Structure

The single navigation contract for `docs/` in projects using the Domdhi.Agents
template. `docs/` is organized **by concern — the question each doc answers** —
not by artifact type or producer. The domain names are identical on every
project, so any path here is correct everywhere (ADR: docs/ Domain Taxonomy).

## The seven domains

| Domain | Question it answers | Canonical contents |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **product/** | *Why does this exist & what must it do?* | `brief.md`, `requirements.md`, `context.md`, `brainstorm.md`, `research.md` |
| **architecture/** | *How is it built & why these choices?* | `overview.md`, `api.md`, `data-model.md`, `decisions/NNNN-*.md` (ADRs) |
| **design/** | *How is it experienced?* (UI only) | `spec.md`, `wireframes.md`, `theme.light.md`, `theme.dark.md`, `mock.html` |
| **engineering/** | *How do we work on it?* | `setup.md`, `conventions.md`, `testing.md` |
| **operations/** | *How do we ship & run it?* | `deploy.md`, `observability.md`, `security.md`, `runbooks/*.md` |
| **work/** | *What now & next?* (the living plan) | `backlog.md`, `roadmap.md`, `timeline.md`, `todo/` (+ `_archive/`) |
| **reference/** | *How do I find my way?* | `onboarding.md`, `glossary.md`, `links.md` |

Plus two non-domain elements:

- **`modules/{name}/`** — a *fractal* axis, not a domain. Per-feature zoom: each
  module folder is a mini domain-set, usually just `brief.md` until it earns more.
- **`.output/`** — the ephemeral/generated zone (the only deep tree). Agents
  **write** here and rarely re-read; quarantining it keeps the seven domains
  clean to scan. Holds generated reports **and** task working files
  (`.output/.state/work/{date}/{task}/`).

## Conventions

- **No `_` prefix.** The folder provides the namespace: `product/requirements.md`,
  the "scaffolded-but-unfilled" gate job.
- **Every domain is a folder, even single-file ones.** Predictability beats saving
  a directory level — the set degrades by leaving a folder empty/absent, never by
  relocating its file.
- **Cross-cutting concerns are not domains.** Security/performance/accessibility
  live *within* domains (the threat model is `architecture/decisions/`, secret
  handling is `operations/security.md`), never as a sibling folder.
- **`work/` owns the durable plan** (backlog, roadmap, timeline, todo). Ephemeral
  task working files live in the generated zone at `.output/.state/work/{date}/{task}/`,
  not in `work/` — so the living plan stays scannable and scratch never ships.
- **`.output/` is operational.** Only the regenerable/session-specific subdirs are
  gitignored (`work/`, `memories/`, `telemetry/`, `screenshots/`, `sessions/`,
  generated `status.html`); durable records (`plans/`, `reviews/`, `research/`,
  `investigations/`, `handoffs/`) are **tracked**.

## Adding a New Module

```bash
mkdir -p docs/modules/{module-name}
# Create brief.md with: scope, key files, dependencies
```

## Where To Look

| Need To... | Look Here |
|------------|-----------|
| Understand the product | `docs/product/requirements.md` |
| Understand the tech stack | `docs/architecture/overview.md` |
| Find an architecture decision | `docs/architecture/decisions/` |
| Understand the design system | `docs/design/spec.md` |
| Learn how we work / conventions | `docs/engineering/conventions.md` |
| Ship & run it | `docs/operations/` |
| Understand a specific module | `docs/modules/{module}/brief.md` |
| Track implementation | `docs/work/backlog.md`, `docs/work/todo/` |
| Find reviews and audits | `docs/.output/findings/reviews/` |
| Session continuity | `docs/.output/handoffs/` (latest, via handoff-path.js) |
