# Domdhi.Agents — System Map

Complete inventory of commands, agents, skills, hooks, and core scripts — and how they wire together.

This is a **reference** doc: tables, inventories, and workflow graphs, kept in sync with what's actually on disk. For the conceptual framing — what a command, agent, skill, or hook *is*, and how the three tiers compose — read the explainer docs in [`../concepts/`](../concepts/): [`commands.md`](../concepts/commands.md), [`agents.md`](../concepts/agents.md), [`skills.md`](../concepts/skills.md), [`memory.md`](../concepts/memory.md), [`hooks.md`](../concepts/hooks.md). For the rendered per-command detail (flowcharts, dispatch shape), see [`./commands.md`](./commands.md).

## Duplication & Overlap — RESOLVED

### Commands deduped (2026-04-10)
Removed from all `create/*` commands:
- **Inline interview questions** — commands now reference the agent's skill Interview Questions section
- **Inline validation checklists** — commands now reference the skill's Required Sections Checklist
- **"Read skill" instructions** — removed from 15 commands (agents auto-load skills via frontmatter `skills:` field)

One intentional exception: `specialize.md` tells the architect to read `tailwind-css-patterns` as a format exemplar (not its own skill).

**Principle established**: Commands own orchestration (gates, mode detection, delegation, validation, commit). Skills own domain knowledge (templates, quality criteria, checklists, interview questions). Agents own personality and working style. No overlaps.

### Skills with no command consumers (but wired to agents)
| Skill | Status |
|-------|--------|
| tailwind-css-patterns | Loaded by ux-designer; also used as format exemplar by /specialize |
| full-output-enforcement | Loaded by general-purpose agent |
| systematic-debugging | Loaded by general-purpose agent |
| verification-before-completion | Loaded by general-purpose agent |
| finishing-a-development-branch | Loaded by general-purpose agent |
| using-git-worktrees | Loaded by general-purpose agent |
| design-taste-frontend | Loaded by ux-designer agent |
| redesign-existing-projects | Loaded by ux-designer agent |
| documentation | Loaded by doc-writer agent |
| content-formats | Not wired to any agent — standalone skill |
| writing-skills | Not wired to any agent — standalone skill |

## Core Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `gate.js` | Build/test gate with auto-detection. Output: `docs/.output/telemetry/` |
| `constants.js` | System-wide constants, phase artifacts, doc chain, memory decay config |
| `scaffold.js` | Copies templates → `docs/` and root configs |
| `memory-manager.js` | Memory CRUD + search + active-day decay + linting (JSON + SQLite FTS5) + inbox pattern (`inboxList/Promote/Discard`) + `deleteMemory` for /review:memory-defrag merge operations |
| `memory-manager-cli.js` | CLI dispatcher for memory-manager — adds `delete <category> <id>`, `inbox-list`, `inbox-promote <id> [--category <c>] [--id <i>]`, `inbox-discard <id>` |
| `memory-compiler.js` | Daily log → concept article compilation pipeline + cross-references (retired 2026-04-20 — preserved as backward-compat module; not prescribed in new pipeline) |
| `memory-extractor.js` | Haiku-powered structured extraction from daily logs via `claude -p` |
| `memory-curator.js` | Haiku-powered dedup/contradiction/merge analyzer — runs on Stop when `MEMORY_PROFILE=strict` |
| `memory-promoter.js` | Scan/rank/mark concepts for promotion to templates/skills |
| `memory-ingester.js` | Convert legacy daily recaps to daily log format (`ingest`, `status`, `--dry-run`) |
| `daily-log.js` | Standalone daily log capture — called by `memory-capture.cjs` Stop hook and pre-compaction hook |
| `decision-viz.js` | Decision log visualization — 6 data source parsers → vis.js Timeline + Network HTML |
| `metrics.js` | Workflow metrics from telemetry + git + TODOs |
| `template-updater.js` | Zone-aware template sync to downstream projects (`--merge`, `--dry-run`) |
| `status.js` | TODO progress + metrics → text + HTML dashboard |
| `memory-health-check.js` | Headless memory health check — lint + decay report for `/review:memory-health` |
| `cleanup-logs.js` | Prune old gate logs |
| `gen-timeline.js` | Weekly commit history generator → `docs/_project-timeline.md` |
| `profile.js` | Memory profile resolver (`MEMORY_PROFILE=minimal\|standard\|strict`). Hooks call `isAtLeast()` to gate expensive work |
| `memory-benchmark.js` | Weekly recall hit-rate benchmark — Haiku picks expected slug per daily-log entry, compared against `searchMemories()` top-5 |
| `_lib/epic-overlap.js` | Parses `_backlog.md` for per-epic file ownership and reports cross-epic overlaps. CLI used by `/create:project-epics` (warning) and `/review:check-readiness` (gate, with `## Acknowledged Overlaps` escape hatch) |

### Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`)

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `secret-scanner.cjs` | Pre-Write/Edit | Blocks secrets from being written to files |
| `guardrail.cjs` | Pre-Bash | Blocks/confirms destructive commands via `guardrail-rules.yaml` |
| `pre-compaction-archive.cjs` | Pre-Compact | Snapshots state + daily log before context compaction |
| `post-read-scrubber.cjs` | Post-Read | Warns on secrets in read files (non-blocking) |
| `organize.cjs` | Post-ExitPlanMode, Post-Bash | Organizes plans + screenshots into dated folders |
| `damage-control.cjs` | Post-Bash | Error analysis on failures — prevents retry spin loops |
| `command-usage-logger.cjs` | Post-Read/Bash | Logs command invocations + gate runs to `docs/.output/telemetry/` |
| `memory-guard.cjs` | Post-Write | Warns when memory category approaches limit |
| `memory-capture.cjs` | Stop, PostToolUse:Bash | Captures daily log on Stop + curates under strict profile; commit enrichment on Bash. Compile pipeline retired 2026-04-20. |
| `session-start-prime.cjs` | SessionStart | Injects top structured memories (JSON from `memory-manager.js`) as system-reminder at session opening |
| `edit-capture.cjs` | Post-Edit | Captures edits to canonical docs (CLAUDE.md, architecture, skills) as daily-log entries (`MEMORY_PROFILE=strict` only) |
| `path-guardrail.cjs` | PreToolUse:Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit | Blocks write/edit ops via four-tier path schema (zeroAccessPaths/readOnlyPaths/noDeletePaths) and freeze-state |
| `secret-patterns.cjs` | (shared module) | Secret/credential regex patterns — used by `secret-scanner.cjs` and git pre-commit hook |
